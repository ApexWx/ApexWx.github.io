    <em> <strong></strong></em><strong>About Apex Wx</strong><strong><br>
    </strong>
    <p><strong> </strong>This is a personal, non-governmental weather
      information website which primarily focuses on weather that will affect <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Kent,_Maine" title="Fort Kent, Maine">Fort
        Kent</a> and the <a href="https://www.upperstjohn.com/" title="Upper Saint John Valley">Upper
        Saint John Valley</a> of Maine. This is not a professional
      meteorological site; however, the website author undertook a course of
      studies via Penn State University leading to a certificate in weather
      forecasting with topics of study that included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fundamental principles of synoptic and physical meteorology, satellite
        and radar imagery, and data analysis in the setting of mid-latitude
        weather forecasting;</li>
      <li>applying atmospheric principles to small-scale weather systems, with
        an emphasis on the conceptual modeling and short-range prediction of
        severe thunderstorms;</li>
      <li>applying atmospheric principles to the tropics, with an emphasis on
        the development, structure, prediction, and destructive impact of
        hurricanes;</li>
      <li>exploring highly specialized topics and techniques in weather
        forecasting that span from mesoscale to planetary spatial scales and
        short-term to long-range time scales</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The author is also a NWS trained storm spotter, too. A key point is that
      a meteorologist is a scientist who studies the atmosphere, while a weather
      forecaster applies that knowledge to predict short-term weather patterns.
      A meteorologist encompasses the entire field of atmospheric science, while
      a weather forecaster focuses on creating and communicating weather
      predictions.</p>
