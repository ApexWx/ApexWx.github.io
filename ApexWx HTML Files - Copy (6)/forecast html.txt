<p> A slow-moving cold front currently quasi-stalled over the
                  Allagash/North Woods will move across the SJV today. Rain is
                  likely this morning with the personal weather station already
                  recording 1.70-inches of rainfall at 9:30 am, which is well
                  above the record rainfall for Fort Kent of 0.82-inch set in
                  1978. A flood advisory is in effect until 9:45 am for
                  Aroostook County this morning due to the excessive rainfall. </p>
                <p> Rain will taper to showers this afternoon as the front moves
                  into the Maritimes with showers tapering off this evening.
                  Partly cloudy skies will overspread the Fort Kent region
                  tonight with fog expected overnight with near calm winds. </p>
                <p> For Sunday, NWS Caribou notes that "[a] large trough of low
                  pressure will be centered over east central Canada on Sunday
                  as a corridor of dry air wrapping around the trough extends up
                  across our region. This will bring a sunny to partly cloudy
                  and dry day with light winds and high temperatures around 5
                  degrees above normal" (4:32 AM EDT Sat. Oct 15, 2022 Area
